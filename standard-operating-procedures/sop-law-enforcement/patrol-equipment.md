### **Electronic Restraint Devices - Taser** <a href="#soplawenforcement-electronicrestraintdevices-taser" id="soplawenforcement-electronicrestraintdevices-taser"></a>

Officers on duty carry taser devices with two cartridges. This tool is considered less than lethal but not entirely non lethal due to inherent risks to health, location of prong strike, and the situation the subject is in.

* When preparing to taser a subject, officers should issue a warning to the effect of “If you do not comply, I will tase you.”
* When a taser is deployed, officers should where possible declare ‘taser taser taser’ before firing.
* No subject should be tased on ladders, vehicles, edges of rooftops (or when running/walking towards an edge) or near slopes or drops.
* Tasers should not be deployed on persons standing in water above ankle height, Any person tased in water of any sort should be actively removed from this drowning risk as soon as possible for their own safety. It is however preferable to tase subjects away from water where possible.
* Due to the limitation on cartridges you carry, tasers should be preferentially used as a compliance tool, not the first method of stopping foot pursuits. Tasers provide us with a vital tool that allows us to disarm subjects with edged or blunt weapons without using lethal force; it is ideal to save your cartridges for these cases where a life might be saved rather than someone running. Tackling is a favored option for these cases.
