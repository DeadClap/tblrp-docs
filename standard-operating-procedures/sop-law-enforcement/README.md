# SOP - Law Enforcement

### Our Mission

Our Goal as law enforcement officers is to protect those that cannot protect themselves; to save lives, and to protect freedom and liberty in the State of San Andreas. We follow a code of professionalism, courtesy, respect, and trust; our citizens depend on us in their time of need, we are there when they call.

### Chain of Command

Each Department is run by its Chain of Command, these are led by the **State Commissioner**, **Police Chief** and **Sheriff** respectively. Their job is to run the department and as a team, coordinate standard operating procedures for Law Enforcement personnel.

The CoC’s role also is to make sure the LEO Members are well informed with new changes happening, maintain discipline, maintain RTO and act as patrol duty supervisors.

Your Chain of command includes Sergeants, a Lieutenant and a Deputy Commissioner, Chief Deputy, or Assistant Chief.\
\
You can find a full list of these in the Staff Channel sidebar in Teamspeak (click the channel to view the sidebar). **You should always aim to contact your Sergeant first** or post a question in **#AskCoC** in Discord.

### **Uniform Policies**

Each individual department has its own uniform policy. In addition, short and long sleeves can only be used during certain time periods of the year.

During winter, we mandate long sleeves for all officers (or winter jackets) that lasts from November 1st to January 31st.

Note: See your department’s Uniform Structure in CAD or through Gitbooks for details.

**You are not to drive any law enforcement vehicle when off duty, unless you are a detective (unmarked) or other subdivision that are permitted take home cars.**\
\
**Each Department has specific requirements for vehicles from plate, to lighting setup/window tint, refer to your department uniform structure to find this information.**

### \*\*Vehicle Equipment \*\*

All law enforcement vehicles contain the following equipment for use during your duty:

* First Aid Kit
* Fire Extinguisher
* Prybar
* Scene Tape
* Traffic Cones
* Narcotics Test Kit - For field testing samples for positive/negative narcotics results
* Carbine Rifle MK2 or Carbine Rifle and Pump Shotgun in vehicle rack. (Ride Along Partners may keep their weapons in the trunk)
* Latex Gloves
* Road Flares
* Duty Bag containing Ticket books, notepads, pens, and reports
* Spike Strips
* Plate Carrier - if not worn for duty
* Rain Jacket
* High Visibility Vest - For Traffic Control
* Extra Equipment such as batteries, cable ties, tape and hand sanitizer

### **Personal Equipment** <a href="#soplawenforcement-personalequipment" id="soplawenforcement-personalequipment"></a>

All law enforcement personnel have the following items for use during their duty:

* Individual First Aid Kit (On person)
* Sidearm
* Additional Magazines
* Taser
* 2 Taser Cartridges
* Handcuffs
* Baton
* Radio
* Latex Gloves
* Pens
* Notebook

### **Weapons** <a href="#soplawenforcement-weapons" id="soplawenforcement-weapons"></a>

All officers are equipped with a number of standard duty loadouts. These can be accessed by using standard commands in the text command line by pressing T and typing the spawn identifiers. Typing /clear removes your weapon loadout.

They are as follows:

* Baton
* Taser
* Service Pistol W/ Torch
* Pump Shotgun W/ Torch
* Mk II Carbine Rifle W/ Torch, Grip and any scope of the officer’s choice.(LEO1) Carbine Rifle W/ Torch, Grip (LEO2)

### **Electronic Restraint Devices - Taser** <a href="#soplawenforcement-electronicrestraintdevices-taser" id="soplawenforcement-electronicrestraintdevices-taser"></a>

Officers on duty carry taser devices with two cartridges. This tool is considered less than lethal but not entirely non lethal due to inherent risks to health, location of prong strike, and the situation the subject is in.\
\\

* When preparing to tase a subject, officers should issue a warning to the effect of “If you do not comply, I will tase you.”
* When a taser is deployed, officers should where possible declare ‘taser taser taser’ before firing.
* No subject should be tased on ladders, vehicles, edges of rooftops (or when running/walking towards an edge) or near slopes or drops.
* Tasers should not be deployed on persons standing in water above ankle height, Any person tased in water of any sort should be actively removed from this drowning risk as soon as possible for their own safety. It is however preferable to tase subjects away from water where possible.
* Due to the limitation on cartridges you carry, tasers should be preferentially used as a compliance tool, not the first method of stopping foot pursuits. Tasers provide us with a vital tool that allows us to disarm subjects with edged or blunt weapons without using lethal force; it is ideal to save your cartridges for these cases where a life might be saved rather than someone running. Tackling is a favored option for these cases.

### **Unit Number Designations** <a href="#soplawenforcement-unitnumberdesignations" id="soplawenforcement-unitnumberdesignations"></a>

These Designators will be used in your name in TeamSpeak when in patrol as Emergency Services as a prefix. (Eg: DL-DDD) To allow other units, civilians, and dispatch to know unit availability.

### **Sub Divisions** <a href="#soplawenforcement-subdivisions" id="soplawenforcement-subdivisions"></a>

Sub Divisions are additional or complementary specialist units for law enforcement that provide expert assistance to patrol officers. These are open to join for any qualified LEO members without current active disciplinary action against them.\
\\

At this time they include:

|              |                                                   |                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ASU**      | Air Support Unit                                  | Aerial spotting and tracking/ Observation                          |

| **TEU**      | Traffic Enforcement Unit                          | Traffic accident investigation, DUI enforcement and road safety    |
| **MBU**      | Motorbike Unit _(Part of TEU)_                    | Similar to TEU but on motorcycles                                  |
| **CVE**      | Commercial Vehicle Enforcement _(Part of TA)_     | Specialists in Commercial Vehicle laws                             |
| **CIU**      | Criminal Investigations Unit                      | Investigative Unit for serious crimes                              |
| **OFI**      | Office of Fire Investigations                     | Investigative Unit for fires                                       |

| **TA**       | Transit Police                                    | Bus and Train System Enforcement                                   |
| **PR**       | Park Rangers: Animal control / Parks Enforcement  | Equipped to handle animal related calls and state park enforcement |
| **DOC**      | Department of Corrections                         | Prisons and Prisoner Transport                                     |
| **SWAT**     | Special Weapons and Tactics                       | Specialist Armed Intervention                                      |
| **GVPD**     | Grapeseed Volunteer Police Department             | Corn Enforcement Unit                                              |

\
\\

When specialist tools are needed, it is required to call for Sub Division assets. For example, TEU Would be called in for traffic accidents and intoxicated drivers. CIU would be called in for serious crime investigation and negotiation.\
\
\*\* Speed Enforcement Unit is technically a subdivision; however, members are selected by each department’s chain of command as a reward for performance and respond to regular calls for service alongside other officers.

### **Use of Force** <a href="#soplawenforcement-useofforce" id="soplawenforcement-useofforce"></a>

Force is a complex subject within Law Enforcement and a critical one to understand.

In the execution of our duties, we may need to utilize force to gain control of a subject and make an arrest. Our goal for all situations is to safely secure a suspect and hand them along with a criminal case to the judicial system for trial and sentencing.\
\
Naturally, the level of resistance by a suspect may require officers to deploy increased force to safely detain the individual. You should always aim to utilize reasonable force at all times based on the present circumstances.

For example, shooting someone is in most cases, not an appropriate use of force against an unarmed subject.

The most simple way to explain force is via a process of escalation.

\\

If a subject has bare fists, Utilize your hands or baton.

If they have a bladed weapon, and you have a cover officer with a lethal weapon, you may utilize a taser.

**(If you are alone and facing someone with a Melee/bladed weapon, utilize lethal force.)**

\\

At all times when facing a subject with a melee weapon, attempt to maintain a distance of roughly 30ft (10m) this allows reaction time to safely stop the subject should they attempt to reach you.

If they have a firearm, a firearm is a justifiable response.

Lethal force is justified when a subject presents an imminent threat to your safety, and or the safety of others. (Note: Simply holding a weapon does not justify lethal force necessarily, nor does having previously justified lethal force. Treat every interaction as a flexible continuum.)

At all times, we should be communicating with the suspect, and potentially warning them of our intent to use force against them if they do not comply with our lawful orders.

Commands such as “Stop resisting.” or “If you do not stop resisting I may have to use force.” can be utilized to gain compliance.

\\

**Note, that at all times when you are interacting with the public, be they victims, witnesses or suspects, your body camera is to be running at all times to provide accountability and protect both them and you. (Note, Dash camera in your patrol vehicle automatically starts when the emergency lights are on with 30 seconds prior)**

**Reasonable Force**

**Force** is **reasonable** if a **reasonable** person would think it necessary to use **force** and would have used the same level of **force** as the defendant. This test is fundamentally objective: the defendant may not decide for himself what is **reasonable** based on his own values.

**Lethal Force**

Lethal Force is used when a suspect poses an imminent risk to life (yourself, or others). This means that you reasonably believe your life, or the life of another is in danger or you risk incapacitation.

Remember that civilians have lives too, and that while we have legal grounds in many cases to use lethal force, we should exercise all reasonable steps first to deescalate a situation to save lives. In this same vein, lethal force authorisation (by circumstance or command authorisation) is not a permanent right to shoot a suspect. If they no longer pose an imminent threat to life, do your best to detain them alive to face justice.

**Investigation**

During the conduct of your duties, it will be necessary to investigate crimes. This can be done through the use of **/me** and **/ooc** commands to communicate in roleplay terms with the civilian party involved. This information is to be used ‘as given’ by the civilian and no names, in or out of character are to be taken from the message headers unless expressly communicated as such in the message.

If a firearm is involved in a scene, you may ask for the serial number and are able to run this in your MDT.

Cell Phones or computers whether unlocked or locked require permission or a warrant to search.

Do note that while the Criminal Investigations Unit exists to investigate serious crimes and officer-involved shootings, an investigation is a necessary part of patrol duty for law enforcement officers; be prepared to interact with a civilian to follow their scene.\
\
**Remember, as patrol officers you are fully able and responsible for investigating crimes that have occured. While in larger cases it would be prudent to request CIU, for most crimes you yourselves are able to ask for witness statements, canvas for sightings, check CCTV and request CSU for print sweeps to investigate your call to its conclusion.**

### **Be On the Lookout For (BOLO)**

A BOLO is a description in the CAD of a person, vehicle, or property. These notes are visible to all officers to **be on the lookout** for them. Criteria for BOLOs are listed below. If the criteria cannot be met, the BOLO cannot be submitted in the system.

| Person BOLO                                                                                                                                                                         | Vehicle BOLO                                                                                    | perty BOLO                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <ul><li>gender</li><li>skin color</li><li>shirt (type + color)</li><li>pants (type + color)</li><li>something that makes the person stand out among others</li><li>reason</li></ul> | <ul><li>type of vehicle</li><li>color</li><li>30% of the license plate</li><li>reason</li></ul> | <ul><li><strong>exact</strong> description of the item</li><li>reason</li></ul> |

For any form of Bolo you should add your unit number at the end so officers know who to contact regarding said person, vehicle or item.

\\

**Arrest / Citation Records**

_**Note: All transportation of suspects is conducted routine (no lights or sirens).**_

It is important for officers to maintain arrest and citation records to provide an accurate criminal record for civilians. When a civilian is given a citation, written warning or arrested, the information about that citation or arrest needs to be inputted into the CAD system.\
\
Note, you must roleplay acquiring the person’s details, either through the information they give to you, ID documents they give you or fingerprints if they have a criminal record. You may also identify them by asking for their full name and date of birth and roleplaying comparing their DMV photograph to the person in your custody.

Utilize the Penal Code to find the correct charges to apply to the arrested party, (Ctrl+F is your friend) ensure you are expedient in your charging process, keeping a civilian in the cells for an extended time isn’t fair to their roleplay (If detainment without investigation or purposeful interaction extends beyond 15 minutes they are free to go). If you need help with charges, ask other officers or supervisors. (reference penal code 14.8)\
\
Ensure that an arrested party is uncuffed before you utilize the jail command (/arrest \[serverID]) and they are sent to prison.

Every arrest and citation filed in the CAD should have short officer notes attached. Failure to include any arrest notes will result in the automatic removal of the charge if the civilian contests it, whether they are guilty or not.\
\
A short descriptive note should be attached. Long descriptions are not necessary, only vital information.\
\\

Ensure you have the evidence to charge a person correctly before charges are filed and they are sent to jail, once they begin serving their sentence, no charges may be added or changed as double jeopardy will apply (they are serving time for this crime already) However, before being sent to jail with the jail script, if a charge is missed it can be added.

Example:\
**Charges:** Felony Evading a Police Officer, Driveby Shooting, Possession of an Illegal Weapon, Attempted Murder, Brandishing a Firearm,\
\
“Joe was caught after a vehicle pursuit in which he drove recklessly, he also fired upon officers with an illegal weapon from the car.”

**Note, Officers are not allowed to use the NCIC to look up any of their own characters. This is a logged action and any characters that are looked up this way will receive a warrant for Title 15 Section 6 of the penal code (Unauthorized Use of Computer, Cable, or Telecom Property).**

If your vehicle is not capable of transporting a suspect and no officer is available to do so for you, you must fill all appropriate charges against the suspect in the MDT and read the suspect their charges as if it were a regular arrest at the station. Then, you must uncuff them and use the /arrest command for “county transport” to take them to jail.

### **Warrants** <a href="#soplawenforcement-warrants" id="soplawenforcement-warrants"></a>

If a suspect is not already in custody, the officer can submit a warrant through the CAD. This needs to be done within 24 hours after the crime happened.

Note, CIU investigations are not limited to the 24-hour rule for warrant requests.

#### **Arrest Warrant** <a href="#soplawenforcement-arrestwarrant" id="soplawenforcement-arrestwarrant"></a>

Your warrant should include the following:

* Suspect
* Charges
* Brief summary of the evidence proving the crime and identification of the suspect.

***

***

**Search Warrant**

If additional evidence is needed and the person is not willing to let the detective search their property, the detective will submit a search warrant request. The warrant will include:

* Location to be searched
* Property owner
* Scope of the search - What you expect to find and why you expect to find it (Evidence).

### **Priorities In game** <a href="#soplawenforcement-prioritiesingame" id="soplawenforcement-prioritiesingame"></a>

In-game you will see a priority timer on the top of the screen. This is an indicator used by the civilian department to regulate and keep track of the priorities that are happening.\
\
**YOU ARE NOT TO REACT TO THIS OR CHANGE BEHAVIOR BASED ON THE COUNT DOWN REACHING ZERO OR /INPROGRESS BEING PLACED - THIS IS METAGAMING.**\
\
LEO can call priority on the channel (10-33) for a number of reasons, the vast majority of which do not apply to the timer. (Eg: Foot Pursuit, or Felony Traffic Stop)

\\

\\

If you are already on a call, or stop and a priority/All Call is initiated you **must** remain on scene if there is criminal prosecution (arrest is necessary) to be brought against a subject. Do not leave the scene to respond abandoning an active crime. Use officer discretion in this regard.

\
\
\
\
\
\\

### **All Calls** <a href="#soplawenforcement-allcalls" id="soplawenforcement-allcalls"></a>

\\

All Calls are defined as situations that cause a serious threat to the life of officers or the general public. Until a shots fired situation directly threatens life, only a determined number of officers need to be attached.

Shots fired alone or indirectly are not an all call until fire is ‘effective’ This means once it is coming close enough to you that you feel you are in imminent danger or being struck by bullets.

During statewide patrols, there is a level system in place regarding All Calls:

* Level 1 All Call = All available units in the same county will respond.
* Level 2 All Call = All available units in the state will respond.

### **Calls** <a href="#soplawenforcement-calls" id="soplawenforcement-calls"></a>

Responding to scenes and calls in a timely manner is mandatory. It’s part of our job as law enforcement to care for our community. Just because the priority timer is 5 minutes off being ready, is not an excuse to not respond to calls and officers may be assigned by supervisors if none are taking calls.

If you are attached to a call where an arrestable crime has occured, and you either have a suspect in custody or a victim you **must** remain attached and finish your call properly if an all call is declared. Remember: an all call is for all **available** officers, not all officers.

When attending a scene or traffic stop it is required to create a call for this in the MDT and it should be done at the earliest opportunity and attached to… if not primary, at least secondary should do this and include the plate when possible.

### **Panic Button / Officer In Distress (10-99)** <a href="#soplawenforcement-panicbutton-officerindistress-10-99" id="soplawenforcement-panicbutton-officerindistress-10-99"></a>

When a panic button is pressed by an officer, this initiates an automatic 10-99 (Officer In Distress) response by 3-4 officers. This activates automatic 10-33 (Priority traffic) When the first units arrive on scene they need to advise if any further units are needed for the call. Panic Button presses are not an automatic all call unless life is determined to be at risk.

Due to the fact that those buttons can have an All Call response to them, officers should not utilize this tool for Motor Vehicle Accidents (Use ai 911 caller or your radio)

**Pursuit Tactics**

Vehicle pursuits require coordination, and as such will constitute a priority on the channel allowing for communication of involved and attaching units.

With this there are some rules that need to be followed,

*
  * Do not self-attach to a pursuit, even if it passes you. Wait for dispatch, or units involved, to ask for backup.
  * The maximum number of units in pursuit is 3 unless necessary. Other units should be ready to deploy spikes / roadblocks upon request.
  * The secondary unit or Air One will give 10-20s (aka directions). Utilize your PLD on the screen to give updates to the current road and direction of travel.
  * Only the primary unit or a supervisor can request pursuit ending techniques such as roadblocks or spike strips. These are not to be deployed at will, and misuse will result in disciplinary action.
  * Always call for Air Support during a pursuit when available, as this makes LEO’s job far easier.
  * If shots are fired during a pursuit, back off to a safe distance (100-200m) and follow safely.
  * Do not utilize oncoming lanes unless absolutely necessary and the primary officer reserves the right to call off pursuits if it becomes too dangerous to LEO or civilian life.
  * If a pursuit gets too dangerous, the primary unit, a supervisor or Air One can call in tracking mode. This means that all units should reduce to code 1 and back off to a safe distance (500m - 800m).
* **When an officer gets injured or is in a traffic collision, the last unit needs to break off and assist the injured officer.**
* **When a civ drops an item / leaves a vehicle, the last unit is to secure this object / vehicle.**

\\

Note that you must roleplay vehicle collisions to the best of your ability should they occur during a pursuit (For example: Slow down, pull over and fix a flat tire, or call out of the pursuit).

**APET (Rolling Roadblock)**\
\\

If a pursuit is slow enough and low violence, it is possible to use this technique to bring a pursuit to an end. It is only to be conducted with supervisor approval, and the following conditions must be met:

* Weather: As long as you are able to see a reasonable distance (for safety, no heavy fog).
* Traffic: Light traffic conditions in the immediate area of the maneuver, only due to the unpredictable nature of the suspects.
* Can be used instead of a normal road block, but other methods must be used/failed or deemed inappropriate to use (hostage etc.)
* Sufficient officer presence for the maneuver and back-up.
* The suspect has not fired a firearm or similar devices at officers.

\\

**Spike Strips**

Spike Strips may be deployed on a fleeing vehicle under the following conditions:\
\\

* No hostages are present in the vehicle.
* The vehicle has been fleeing for over 10 minutes and has shown no sign of stopping by other means.
* The road conditions are safe, it isn’t raining and traffic is light.
* Vehicle weight should be considered, careful consideration should be given to larger commercial vehicles and nothing hauling a sensitive or explosive load should ever be spiked.
* No spike strips are to be deployed if speeds exceed 100mph.
* Be conscious of where the spiked vehicle will go after it loses control, do not spike people into gas stations or off cliffs.
* Ensure your position of deployment is safe and secure and you are protected from any impacts or engagement to the best of your ability.

### **Scene Coordination** <a href="#soplawenforcement-scenecoordination" id="soplawenforcement-scenecoordination"></a>

When an active scene takes place that requires large scale law enforcement mobilization, an officer will take scene command. (If a supervisor is present or available, this will usually be them) This individual identified as scene command will issue instructions to ensure the efficient resolution of the scene.

When this is occurring, it is vital that radio traffic be kept to only essential traffic, and more essential than normal that 3-5 seconds are held between communications to make sure traffic is clear, and not cluttered. Do not panic, do not shout where possible, clear coms results in a coordinated scene.\
\
Scene priorities include:\
\
**Containment** - ensuring that suspects are not able to flee the scene and endanger further civilian life.

**Time** - Containing a scene provides law enforcement time to safely resolve the incident.

**Measured response** - Time permits a coordinated response from law enforcement to enact a solution.

Where Detectives are available, they can be called in to provide negotiation during barricade situations. If none are available, a volunteer can fulfill the same role.

Fire and medical assets are not to be called in until a scene is code 4 (safe) unless Tactical EMS assets are on standby, at which point they are able to respond immediately and provide on-scene care.\
\
Stage any fire/medical units a safe distance away until needed.

If a suspect is hospitalized at any point during a scene, officers (Not Fire personnel) must use /ooc to place a hold on them for law enforcement. This can be done at any point up until their release from the hospital; otherwise, they cannot be compelled to stay for law enforcement to pick them up. If a civilian reminds you in ooc they are waiting for pickup and no officers collect them in a reasonable time they are free to leave.

Should a suspect barricade themself inside a store, house, or other building, and then flee, there must be officers left on scene to clear the structure of any threats or gather any evidence left behind. This also goes for cars ditched or other evidence tossed by suspects.

**Target Identification**

When involved in an incident, ensure you are always identifying targets. It is your responsibility to ensure you are utilizing force against the correct persons. Coordinate with other LEO on the scene and ensure you identify them before firing.

When moving through an area with an obstructed view, or a building, immediately call ‘BLUE’ when seeing another LEO to ensure they know you are friendly. (Be mindful of voice radius)

If you cannot safely take a shot because of; obstructed visibility, presence of hostages, or other contributing factors, HOLD FIRE.\
\
It is safer to wait than to accidentally engage a hostage, civilian, or LEO. (Remember that in real life the buildings around us are not solid boxes in a video game, but potentially businesses or homes with people inside, be mindful of this.)\
\
AI are considered civilians and the use of force against them follows the same principle.\
\
Do not get tunnel vision within a scene, always keep situational awareness of the larger picture. Always ensure you are aware of your surroundings at all times, what is in front of, behind, or near a target or friendly unit.\
\
Ensure at all times you are considering cover… not firing is a lot safer when you have somewhere to hide from the bullets.

**Officer Discretion**

As a Law Enforcement Officer, you hold a lot of power in your hands. Circumstances depending, you are able to utilize your best judgment to resolve a situation the best way you feel. In non-felony cases, or in cases without a direct victim that wishes to press charges, you may reduce a charge to a citation in lieu of arrest (A fine, with no jail time that still counts as the charge) or a warning, written or verbal for what took place. Remember that civilians have lives, and our charges can change the path of their character’s story. Accidents happen, and in real life, law enforcement understands that. Use your judgment, and be a human being.

**Subject Searches**

All Subjects should be searched upon arrest, this includes before being placed in a vehicle and after release from hospital even if searched prior (In case any items have been taken during their stay) When a female requests a female officer for a search, they should be obliged where possible, and if it is not possible, should understand that there isn’t one available, and that a search will be conducted (over clothing only) in front of body camera and dash camera for their and the officer’s safety. No member of the opposite sex should search a subject below their base layer clothing (Under an item of clothing next to their skin) under any circumstances. (If this is required, and no member of the subject’s sex is available for a search, you may utilise county officers at this time. Items found under a subject’s clothing should be verbally identified for the camera and subject before being removed as carefully as possible.

**Probable Cause**

Apparent facts discovered through logical inquiry that would lead a reasonably intelligent and prudent person to believe that an accused person has committed a crime, thereby warranting his or her prosecution and/or search of his or her person or property.

**Reasonable Suspicion**

A legal standard of proof that requires specific and articulable facts taken together with rational inferences from those facts. For example, a report of a Blue and White Rumpo Van shooting at another car at a location followed by a peace officer observing an identical van within 500’ and 2 minutes of the event would be reasonable suspicion. On the other hand, a report of a blue van committing an offense at a location would not be reasonable suspicion to pull over a blue van 20 minutes and 3 miles away.

**Props**\
\
Law Enforcement Characters ON DUTY may spawn a maximum of 5 props on a scene (This includes total props for a scene, not just per officer. This is for items like traffic cones where necessary if you choose. ANY props must be cleared up afterwards and should when possible have supervisor approval via DM.

**Characters**

Law Enforcement/Fire personnel have the ability to create a large number of characters in the CAD. These can be created on the civilian government page by selecting “Create a New LEO/Fire/EMS Character”.\
\
These characters are for use on duty in your main department or any divisions as you choose. It is encouraged to have several officer characters as it adds to roleplay immersion and creativity. Note; that when off duty, you should maintain legal status. Using these characters to commit crimes will result in your officer losing their job and facing a discussion with your Chain of Command.

This allows us greater diversity to live a full life with our emergency services characters including friends, families, and off duty activities such as shopping or leisure.\
\
Do note, when you are off duty, you are OFF DUTY: You are not to respond to a witnessed or ‘heard’ criminal act. Your department’s insurance does not cover you.

However, if you are directly involved in an incident, you may act in self-defense and identify yourself. Immediately call 911 and report the crime, and identify that an off duty officer is on scene.

You are not to drive any law enforcement vehicle when off duty unless you are a department head or a detective who are permitted to take-home cars.

You may only carry weapons off duty that are personally owned and within your civilian tier, not any of your law enforcement equipment which is logged in after duty.

You should at no point ride along with a family member or loved one when both are on duty and if you respond to a scene involving a family member, you need to call a supervisor or other unit to replace you on scene as you are not permitted to handle it (Call a supervisor to the scene to handle it for you.). This includes discovering a family member has responded to the same call as emergency services personnel with you, you are to recuse yourself. The only exception is an all call being triggered in which case you may still attend, however you cannot be scene command or primary, nor can they.

**Ride Along Policy**

During a patrol, LEO qualified members may ride together as a ‘car’ unit and may run with members of other departments. The officer driving the vehicle dictates the livery of the vehicle. In teamspeak, you must add ‘Car 1 / 2 / 3’ to your name after your unit designator. You should also inform dispatch of this fact, and or the channel, and identify who is handling the radio and MDT.

At no time should there be more than 4 car units total and if we need assets for scene handling car units may be asked to split up to respond to calls as needed.\
\
Department Mentors working to help other officers take priority in car unit totals… if a mentor has arranged with a member to work with them, a supervisor may request a car unit voluntarily separate to allow this field coaching to take place for the betterment of us all.

\
**Civilian Ride Along Policy**

When a civilian wishes to go on a ride-along with an officer, they must be approved by a supervisor if one is available (If none are on patrol the officer themselves must do this). The supervisor will run their identity, and check their record (No felonies or violent crimes). The civilian may not be armed and must have a vest on (department issue) at all times. They must be minimum of 16 (parental consent required) and 18 without.

\
If the officer is required to go to a violent call (All Call), they should drop the civilian off at the nearest station first before responding. Otherwise, they are not to respond to violent calls with a civilian in the vehicle.

You are not allowed to conduct a ridealong with family members, spouses and partners while both on active duty. You are still expected to act in a professional manner; the ride along, whomever it may be to the officer, is to not be treated differently than any other civ ride along.\
\
Note, civilians must remain in civilian frequency at all times and no ‘in character’ recording should occur without Senior command approval (Department head or 2ic)

**Roleplay**

While we as officers aim to roleplay as law enforcement to the highest degree of accuracy, we must remember that we are part of a community. Whether we patrol as LEO, Fire, EMS, Civilian or Dispatch, we must show everyone respect in and out of character. This is, at the end of the day, a game. We are here to have fun. Needlessly stacking charges to win a ‘biggest arrest’ game, or looking for the slightest ‘excuse’ to charge a civilian who is clearly not intending to create a criminal scene are not called for.\
\
We take a serious stance on this at Aspirant Gaming. We are a family, play fair.\
\
When injured in the line of duty, officers should roleplay out their injuries realistically. Whether this is being ‘gta killed’ or simply taking bullets, you should be realistic about this. Roleplaying that you’re hit in the vest every time you’re shot isn’t realistic… also consider that medics will get roleplay from a flesh wound or other injury.\
\
Character death is entirely your own choice. No player, civilian or LEO can force death upon another. You decide your own fate in your own story. Do bear in mind that killing a character from a fist or blunt melee weapon is not legitimate in the aim of fairness to civilians clearly not displaying lethal intent.\
\
Regarding injury and death, refer to the Civilian SOP. If you are injured and hospitalized from a scene, you may not return to it. You may only return post-scene as Fire or EMS.

If you are on duty as a LEO, you cannot claim ownership of a property on the map if a civilian is using it for a scene. This easily leads to powergaming scenes and it will not be tolerated. We have a very limited number of properties with interiors in game and it's important that we're not trying to powergame one another when others are attempting to use them.

\\

As law enforcement officers, it is our duty to be kind and courteous in the face of aggression and disruption. It is not an easy task, however it is our job to deescalate a scene rather than escalate it. By being calm and respectful, we not only increase the trust citizens place on us, but help to reduce the stress level of a scene or situation and prevent injury or escalation.

If a citizen asks you to identify yourself, or it is required for the task you are performing (e.g. a traffic stop), you must do so either with your department **and** surname, your badge number, or all of these options. Any of these will provide the needed information to identify yourself to the public.

**Off Duty**

When you are off duty playing as your emergency services qualified character you have no law enforcement powers and are not covered by department insurance to act in that capacity.\
\
At no point should you interfere with or inject yourself into a scene being handled by on duty personnel and should follow all their instructions. Remember they are your colleagues and you are a law abiding citizen, you wouldn’t argue or interfere.\
\
You may carry a weapon off duty as long as you fully comply with civilian requirements.

Badges are not to be worn off duty unless on an active crime scene or incident, to do so randomly out shopping is unrealistic. While we do not prohibit the wearing of department t-shirts off duty, be aware that this is quite unrealistic for real officers and usually isn’t done outside of certain places like the gym, or social functions (shirts) or when in a station or at a crime scene or accident (badges) these things can and will make you a target for those that hate law enforcement and will signal you as a primary target to criminals attempting a robbery (They will shoot you first as the biggest threat)

While we do not prohibit the wearing of department badges or the department tee shirts off duty, be aware that this is quite unrealistic for real officers and usually isn’t done outside of certain places like the gym, or social functions (shirts) or when in a station or at a crime scene or accident (badges) these things can and will make you a target for those that hate law enforcement and will signal you as a primary target to criminals attempting a robbery (They will shoot you first as the biggest threat)\
\
Note, that you can and will be removed from emergency services qualified status on a given character if you commit crimes off duty and or lose your drivers licence due to traffic infractions.

\\

**Lore Vehicles and Uniforms**

It is possible to interact with persons using the lore vehicles (Fire, Ambulance or Law Enforcement) for impersonation roleplay purposes and or various uniforms not existing as ‘departments’ within the community. This fact alone is not reason to suspect foul play.\
\
Brands of vehicles such as Vapid or Bravado or MTL shouldn’t be factored into a vehicle being suspicious such as an unmarked Bravado Buffalo if everything else appears normal, it should be left alone.\
\
Lore Liveries represent ‘old’ liveries used by various departments and can be questioned or queried.\
\
Uniforms and badges of departments that exist in lore, but not in our world to join still exist and unless said FIB or DOA/Game Warden/San Fire/ or Ambulance crew give reason to suspect they are not who they say they are, they are to be treated as such.\
\
Please do not metagame… it ruins the fun for us all, and if you bust up a civilian scene too quickly because you immediately saw that their unmarked buffalo isn’t a real charger and the FIB ‘isn’t a department’ you might ruin an amazing scene. Consider how you’d feel if it was you.

**Radio Traffic**

The law enforcement radio channel is to be kept as clear as possible for the passage of information. There should be no conversation on the frequency.

If you need to speak to another officer, request at 10-1 (frequency change) and use the appropriate TeamSpeak channel to have a more open dialogue.

During priorities, all unrelated radio traffic will be held (10-33 Status). Use your MDT (Computer) to set your current status and if a transport or tow is required, PM dispatch, or if one is not available, roleplay it out.

Always attempt to keep your transmissions as short as possible. Think about what you need to say before keying up. This allows for vital information to be transmitted without a channel being locked up with unnecessary communication. Like many states and departments in real life, we use the core common 10 codes to communicate common traffic and plain English for the majority of communications. (In real life, this aids mutual aid cooperation and in an era of digital encryption, code is less relevant.)

### **Call Response**

**Routine Response**

Respond following all\*\* \*\*traffic laws, no lights, no sirens - For when there is no risk to life and no perpetrator is on scene (Reporting a break in, abandoned vehicle etc)

This is also the only response used while transporting suspects.

**Code 1 - Response without Lights or Sirens. (expedited)**

An expedited response to not alert people of law enforcement’s presence (used arriving at silent alarms, domestic assault or other tense volatile calls)

**Code 2** **- Response with lights but no siren.**

A response for when there is a risk to property and or a crime is still occurring but there is no violence.

**Code 3 - Response with lights and sirens, clearing all intersections.**

Response for high risk emergency situations where time is critical - life at risk.

### **Rules & Tips** <a href="#soplawenforcement-rules-and-tips" id="soplawenforcement-rules-and-tips"></a>

* **No Civ Stalking** - Do not needlessly follow a civilian without reasonable suspicion in the hope they will break the law.
* **Don’t assume every civilian is a criminal** - Many are living a normal legal life.
* **Always try to de-escalate (calm down) instead of escalating a situation** - Polite, Firm language will elicit more compliance than threats and anger.
* **Professionalism at all times. Do not lower yourself to the criminals level** - We follow the laws of the state and do not cut corners - Note, ‘bad cop/dirty cop’ RP is not permitted.
* **Maintain confidence and control when talking to individuals or suspects** - Maintaining control does not necessarily mean using the /grab script, however, you can and should maintain control over their movement either verbally or in text chat. ‘I’m holding your arm, follow me.” or ‘/me takes hold by arm and escorts’ - Civilians will Roleplay this.
* **Don’t let civilians or anyone else in-game walk over you** - You are in charge of the situation, however, polite firm authority is far more productive than aggression.
* **Patrol Officers are not able to use Bleetr (Twitter) comments in game to react to** - The sort of networks criminals would use or pages of known criminals wouldn’t be followed by regular officers, leaving these for CIU to respond to and handle through Cybercrimes.
* \*\*Use of Civilian scripts such as Fire or Smoke are prohibited for on duty use. - \*\*This includes using them FOR civilians if they request it.
