# Rolling Road Block - APET

**Conditions for Use:**

* Weather: As long as you are able to see a reasonable distance (for safety, no heavy fog).
* Traffic: Light traffic conditions in the immediate area of the maneuver, only due to the unpredictable nature of the suspects.
* Can be used instead of a normal road block, but other methods must be used/failed or deemed in appropriate to use (hostage ect.)
* Sufficient officer presence for the maneuver and back-up.
* The suspect has not fired a firearm or similar devices at officers.

**Recommendations:**

1. Have sufficient officer presence prior to the attempt of the A.P.E.T.
2.
   1. Five units recommended for heavier vehicles (two in front, one on the remaining sides), four for standard vehicles (one on each side).
   2. Three is the absolute minimum for standard vehicles (one in front, one on each side), do not try with less than four for heavier vehicles (two in front, one on each side).
3. Utilize Subdivisions assets prior and while attempting the A.P.E.T.
4. It is recommended that all cars involved are the fastest possible with good weight. Heaviest in front.

**Performing the A.P.E.T.:**

1. Once it is determined that this A.P.E.T is a valid option, call for additional units to assist.
2. Only the a supervisor may call for this maneuver. 
3. Once additional units arrive, the order will be given shortly to get everyone into formation. The next series of events must occur quickly.
4.
   1. The primary/supervisor gives the order to prepare for rolling road block, this is the formation.

   2. The above will be a giveaway of what is going on so be quick! The Left and right column, (car 1 in front, car 2 in back for both), car 1 in both columns must be the fastest cars in the pursuit. For they will be in the front.
   3. When the order is given to execute the maneuver both the left and right columns will push forward. The center car will speed up as well to close the gap, but keep a reasonable distance in case the suspect decides to break check them. This is the most dangerous part as you will be exposed and vulnerable at this point, so make it quick.

   4. After this the two Lead cars of both columns (cars 1) will continue to speed up to get in front of the suspect. (cars 2) the second in both columns will start to slow down so they can take up position on both sides of the suspect.

   5. At this point the Lead cars call out that they are in position, and call out they are starting to reduce speed to slow the suspect down and the other cars are to match to box the suspect in. Once the suspect gets to a slow enough speed they stop, and take up positions. They are to make contact with the suspect vehicle, in a slow controlled manner to take their final position.

   6. The goal is not to allow any wiggle room to get out. Now the front two officers need to pull out their lethal weapons, since they have direct LOS and little cover from the suspect. The other officers on the side can make a judgement call on what to use depending on the situation. All officers are to use what cover they can, and give commands. The rear officer is to stay in their patrol car to help prevent the suspect from wiggling free, and to start the chase again if they break free.
   7. Once the suspect is in custody, clear the road way as soon as possible, and as safely as possible.
