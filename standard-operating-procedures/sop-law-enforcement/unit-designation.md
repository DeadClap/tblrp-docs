### **Sub Divisions** <a href="#soplawenforcement-subdivisions" id="soplawenforcement-subdivisions"></a>

When specialist tools are needed, it is required to call for Sub Division assets. For example, TEU Would be called in for traffic accidents and intoxicated drivers. CIU would be called in for serious crime investigation and negotiation.\
\
_Speed Enforcement Unit_ is technically a subdivision; however, members are selected by each department’s chain of command as a reward for performance and respond to regular calls for service alongside other officers.
