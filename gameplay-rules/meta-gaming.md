# Meta Gaming

This refers to the act of leveraging out-of-character information or knowledge for personal in-character advantage or gain. Mixing OOC with IC, even if it doesn't provide an advantage, is considered Meta Gaming. It is essential to only apply information or knowledge obtained in-character, excluding any details acquired from external sources such as Discord, Twitch Streams, or OOC Chat.

This includes any information gained from external programs such as **Discord**, **Twitch Streams**, **OOC Chat**.

All radio channels are encrypted, and using police scanners while sitting in RTO, responding to 911 calls, or being "clocked in" in-game, which grants access to police blips, menus, and 911 calls, is considered metagaming unless you are an authorized Law Enforcement Officer playing on your genuine LEO character.



{% hint style="info" %}
Although it is mentioned above, the use of a _**Police Radio Scanner**_ is technically allowed with authorization.

Example of **Meta Gaming**:

{% hint style="danger" %}
`Subject A` goes to `Subject B's` twitch stream and uses it to find the location of `Subject B` to kill him.
{% endhint %}
