# Meta Gaming

This is when you **utilize Out-Of-Character information/knowledge for personal In-Character benefit or gain**. Even if it doesn't put you at an advantage, mixing OOC with IC will be considered Meta Gaming. Only use the information/knowledge you received IC.

This includes any information gained from external programs such as **Discord**, **Twitch Streams**, **OOC Chat**.

All radio channels are encrypted. Using police scanners by sitting in RTO, going to 911 calls, being "clocked in" in-game, which gives you access to police blips, menus, and 911 calls is metagaming, unless you are an authorized LEO playing on your real LEO character. 

Example of **Meta Gaming**:

{% hint style="danger" %}
`Subject A` goes to `Subject B's` twitch stream and uses it to find the location of `Subject B` to kill him.
{% endhint %}
