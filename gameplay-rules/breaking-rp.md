# Breaking RP

You must remain IC at all times while in the server. Breaking character by going OOC should not be happening unless a break-in RP has been initiated while being spoken to an active member of the moderation team.

This includes **voice chat, /tweet, /ebay, /darkweb, /me, /do and /news**.

The only OOC resources players have is **Spawn**, **OOC-chat, and /report**.

Examples of **Breaking RP**:

{% hint style="danger" %}
Saying things such as: "It's lag", "I'm going to report you", "That's not allowed your breaking server rules", "I don't want to roleplay this" etc.
{% endhint %}
