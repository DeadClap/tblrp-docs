# New Life

If your character gets** hurt and dies/passes out**, the moment they respawn after the timer ends they must **forget everything** that has led up to the moment, this means you must roleplay it out that your lost your memory or forgot what happened and cannot return back to the scene for revenge. If EMS shows up on the scene, and you recover from your injuries you may continue to remember the events which occurred with your character.
