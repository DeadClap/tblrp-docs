# New Life

In gaming, particularly in role-playing scenarios, a "New Life Rule" (NLR) is a common term referring to a set of rules or guidelines that dictate how a player should handle their character's death or the end of a particular in-game situation. The specifics of NLR can vary between different gaming communities, but the general principle is to ensure a fair and immersive experience for all players involved.

{% hint style="success" %}
After a character's death or the conclusion of a specific scenario, the player is expected to have their character experience some form of memory loss. This means the character does not remember events leading up to their death or the situation's resolution.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The player should not seek revenge or act based on information their previous character had. This helps prevent cycles of retaliation and promotes a fresh start for the player's new character.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For a brief period after the character's death, the player might be required to avoid the area where the death occurred. This prevents immediate re-engagement in the same situation and encourages exploration of new in-game opportunities.
{% endhint %}

> The New Life Rule is implemented to maintain a sense of realism, prevent metagaming (using out-of-character information in-character), and promote a fair and dynamic gaming environment. Specifics may vary, and communities may have additional or slightly different rules regarding the New Life Rule.
