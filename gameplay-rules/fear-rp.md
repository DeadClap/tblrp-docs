# Fear RP

All characters must operate with some level of **fear for their lives**. While your characters may not truly die, they must act as if their character is subject to fear due to the possibility of being injured or losing their life. You must take into account all repercussions while your life is on the line, you can't be a hero every time.

If an opportunity presents itself where you are not in immediate danger, they may fight back.

Example of **Fear RP**:

{% hint style="danger" %}
`Subject A` is in an alleyway with **4 gang members who all have guns** pointed towards him/her. `Subject A` follows all demands and stays co-operative due to fear for his life.
{% endhint %}
