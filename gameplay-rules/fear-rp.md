# Fear RP

"Fear RP" stands for Fear Roleplay in the context of gaming, particularly in role-playing scenarios. This concept is often used in games where characters can experience fear or danger. Fear RP refers to the expectation that players should roleplay their characters realistically in situations that would naturally invoke fear or anxiety.

When a character is faced with a life-threatening situation, like being surrounded by a hostile group, Fear RP entails reacting as any person would under such circumstances, expressing fear, anxiety, or compliance, rather than acting casually or trying to break character.
