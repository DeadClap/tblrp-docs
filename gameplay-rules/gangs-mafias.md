# Gangs / Mafias

Gangs should not fight each other unless a gang war is occurring. Gang wars may be initiated by encroaching on another gang's territory \(turf\), attempting to kill or killing another gang's member, stealing from another gang, damaging another gang's property, or insulting another gang.

If a gang war is occurring and one group chooses to surrender, the fighting must stop.

Gang wars and/or any form of conflict between groups must be approved by a moderator or higher. When staff knows ahead of time about large conflicts, it can prevent us from unnecessarily pausing large gang fights for staff-sits. 

Gang wars are to be fought between criminal gangs. Do not declare war against a business group like a towing company unless they are a front for a criminal organization.   
  
****Businesses must be realistic with an RP purpose.
