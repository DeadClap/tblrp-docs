# Fail RP



This is anything the can be considered an unrealistic situation. This is usually common sense, simply ask yourself these questions: Does this happen IRL? or Would you do this IRL? or Does this match your character's storyline?

Examples of **Fail RP**:

{% hint style="danger" %}
* Police vehicles are equipped with tracking devices, they cannot be removed. 
* Refusing to verbally identify yourself is fine but you **must **provide your character name if the police run your fingerprints while booking/arresting you. You may not destroy your fingerprints. 
* Using 'Ragdoll' to appear-dead and then getting back up to join a gunfight by surprise.
* Using /carry or cuff/drag to let a player respawn without teleporting to a hospital.
* Applying handcuffs or /carry onto a player who does not agree to it, or is running/walking. You may only handcuff or /carry a person who agrees to it, surrenders (complying), or is not capable of resisting (on the floor, tackled, stunned/tased, incapacitated, etc.).
* Failing to respond to /me /do /sv /sp to avoid roleplay. 
* Being searched and lying about what you posses.
* Spawning/Despawning Vehicles randomly in the public.
* Changing your vehicle's customizations while in a pursuit. Changing your characters clothes while in a pursuit must be roleplayed. 
* Abusing GTA physics, such as jumping mountains in vehicles.
* Not roleplaying injuries, such as being shot multiple times and walking away.
* Using your phone while in handcuffs or while in jail.
* Respawning while LEO or EMS are on scene.
* Using unrealistic vehicles / vehicles mods / floating parts.
* Spamming armor to regenerate armor health.
* Unrealistically locking/unlocking a door you would not have access to. Under normal circumstances, only an officer would have jail and station keys and only a bank manager would have keys to the bank doors.
* Using the LEO menu as a civilian.
* Using the runways for pursuits/races while there is active planes on the runway.
* Thermal vision cannot be used to see **through** objects, water, walls, glass, mountains etc.
  * It can only be used to detect heat that is coming off of surfaces e.g. a person in the open / outside. 
  * Thermal vision cannot be used to see and follow people who are underwater; it is unrealistic.
