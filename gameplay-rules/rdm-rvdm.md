# RDM / RVDM

Killing/running over a player for **no reason** randomly with **no intention to roleplaying the incident**. Prior interaction with a player and a **valid exchange** must be established before you can kill someone. Vehicle Deathmatching is only allowed if the other person **poses a threat** or has had a prior interaction with the player. 

Example of **RDM**:

{% hint style="danger" %}
`Subject A` walks up to `Subject B` who he/she has never interacted with and shoots `Subject B.`
{% endhint %}

Examples of what is **valid** interaction and exchange:

{% hint style="success" %}
`Subject A` has a prior interaction with `Subject B` where `Subject B` had assaulted his wife at a store. `Subject B` fled and then continued to harass his wife online and gave no apology even while `Subject A` had threatened him violently. Finally `Subject A` meets `Subject B` and shoots him.
{% endhint %}

Example of **RVDM:**

{% hint style="success" %}
`Subject A` runs over `Subject B` in his Toyota Prius then drives off as nothing happened.
{% endhint %}
