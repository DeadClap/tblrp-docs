# Power Gaming / Forced RP



Power gaming is the practice of engaging in unrealistic or overly advantageous in-game actions that prioritize personal gain or dominance over role-playing authenticity. It involves forcing specific outcomes or actions on other players without considering their consent or the natural flow of the narrative.

Forced RP, on the other hand, refers to compelling other players to participate in role-playing scenarios or actions against their will. This can disrupt the immersive experience and undermine the voluntary nature of role-playing interactions.

In essence, both power gaming and forced RP go against the principles of collaborative and consent-based role-playing, detracting from the enjoyment and fairness of the gaming experience.
