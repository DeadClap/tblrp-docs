## **Title 0: Preamble and definitions**

### **(0)01. Preamble**

#### For the creation of a document that ensures the safety of the people of San Andreas and a fair, well-documented process for the enforcement of criminal penalties in the State of San Andreas as written in its laws and codes. This document is only for use for in game/in character infractions and does not create a set of rules for use outside of game or outside of character. All members are reminded that all scenarios must comply with Los Santos County Department of Justice RP rules.

### **(0)02. Citing the Code**

#### For consistency and to allow ease of understanding, please refer to penal code entries in one of three ways:

#### With the full title, underlined, prefix first. For example, (1)01. Criminal Threats or (10)01. Drivers Licenses

#### With the prefix (x)xx. For example, (1)01. or (10)01.

#### With the shortening code PCX-XX. For example, PC1-01 or PC10-01

### **(0)03. Definitions**

#### “Administrative Search” - An Administrative search is one that complies with all of the following; Serves a non investigative purpose. Serves the public good. Is only as invasive as required to meet the purpose given. Is applied either to all persons/property within or accessing a given area or is applied in a random manner. May be opted out of prior to the search commencing. Persons who opt out of a search may be denied access to the area being protected by the search. A person may not opt out of an administrative search after entering an area where a notice is published that searches may be conducted.

#### “Affirmative Defense” - A new fact or set of facts that operates to defeat a claim even if the facts supporting that claim are true. Generally when a person admits to committing an act but states he/she has a reason for doing so which nullifies potential conviction. Most commonly used in self-defenses cases

#### “Civilian” or "Citizen" - Any individual who is not an on-duty peace officer or national guardsmen.

#### ”Community Property” - Joint ownership of all property acquired during a marriage. A party of a marriage cannot steal community property as he/she is considered an owner of that property

#### “Contraband” - Any property that it is illegal to produce or possess. In the context of a correctional facility any controller substance or alcoholic substance.

#### “Deadly Force” - When a person intends to cause death or serious bodily harm or when he or she recognizes personal involvement in the creation of a substantial risk that death or bodily harm will occur.

#### “Depraved Indifference to Human Life" When a person engages in conduct that poses a grave risk of death. A person has a depraved indifference to human life when that person has an utter disregard for the value of human life – a willingness to act, not because he or she means to cause grievous harm, but because he or she simply does not care whether or not grievous harm will result. In other words, a person who is depravedly indifferent is not just willing to take a grossly unreasonable risk to human life. Instead, that person does not care how the risk turns out.

#### “Detain” - To prevent from proceeding.

#### “Entrapment” - A practice whereby a law enforcement agent induces a person to commit a criminal offence that the person would have otherwise been unlikely to commit. For example charging a person with possession of a controlled substance after forcing said substance into his/her hand.

#### “Force” - Power, violence, compulsion, or constraint exerted upon or against a person or thing.

#### “Government employee” - Any on-duty employee of a local, state, or federal agency.

#### “Involuntary Intoxication” - A person who was drugged or had their awareness impaired against their will or knowledge.

#### “Malice Aforethought” - With wanton disregard for human life, does an act that involves a high probability that it will result in death.

#### “MDC” - Mobile Database of Criminals, or the official State of San Andreas database system for criminal and personal identification and information."Stacking Charges" refers to a suspect committing a specific crime on multiple occasions or during multiple incidents. Each "stacked charge" or "count" of the crime will be added to the criminal's record and includes all related punishments, subject to (10)00 Exceptions.

#### “Necessity” - With respect to an affirmative defense, the act of committing a violation of the penal code because the alternative would create a significant risk of harm to oneself, others, or a situation worse then if the act were committed. Necessity protections do not apply to property (however self-defense may) and do not apply for cases where the acts of the individual created the need for the violations.

#### “One Party Notification Policy” - So long as one party (either person on the phone, in a facility, or other location where a conversation or event is being recorded) is aware of the situation it is considered a legal recording. Property owners always have full surveillance rights to their property and facilities, parking lots, etc. they maintain.

#### “Peace Officer” - An individual who is, through a badge, unique identifier, or other internal police protocol, an on-duty officer of the law. Departments employing peace officers are expected to maintain appropriate internal policy to distinguish when an officer is on duty, plain clothes, and other states besides a typically uniformed officer.

#### “Person” - Any living human being or individual.

#### “Plain View Doctrine” - Legal doctrine that allows an officer to seize without warrant, evidence and contraband that are found in plain view during a lawful observation. For plain view doctrine to apply the officer must be lawful present at the place where the evidence can be plainly seen, have a lawful right of access to the object, and incriminating character of the object to be “immediately apparent.” The standard of probable cause is used to determine if an object is evidence or contraband. Such items seized under this doctrine can be used as probable cause to obtain an arrest and/or search warrant.

#### “Premeditation” - Planning, plotting or deliberating before doing something.

#### “Probable Cause” - Apparent facts discovered through logical inquiry that would lead a reasonably intelligent and prudent person to believe that an accused person has committed a crime, thereby warranting his or her prosecution and/or search of his or her person or property.

#### “Property” - Anything that is owned by a person or entity.

#### “Reasonable Suspicion” - A legal standard of proof that requires specific and articulable facts taken together with rational inferences from those facts. For example a report of a Blue and White Rumpo Van shooting at another car at a location followed by a peace officer observing an identical van within 500’ and 2 minutes of the event would be reasonable suspicion. On the other hand a report of a blue van committing an offense at a location would not be reasonable suspicion to pull over a blue van 20 minutes and 3 miles away.

#### “Risk” - The potential danger that threatens to harm or destroy an object, event, or person.

#### “Self-Defense” - The protection of one's person or property against some injury attempted by another. Generally a person may use reasonable force when it appears reasonably necessary to prevent an impending injury. A person using force in self-defense should use only so much force as is required to repel the attack. Non Deadly force can be used to repel either a nondeadly attack or a deadly attack. Deadly Force may be used to fend off an attacker who is using deadly force but may not be used to repel an attacker who is not using deadly force. Self defense also applies to the defense of others. Self-Defense does not apply in cases where a person has placed his or herself directly in harm's way (for example by attacking another person or committing a criminal act against another)

#### “Substantial Risk” - Means a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or even a significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist. It is the risk of such a nature and degree that to disregard it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in such a situation.

#### “Terry Frisk” - quickly patting down the clothes of a possible criminal suspect to determine if there is a concealed weapon. This police action is generally considered legal (constitutional) without a search warrant.

#### "Wanton Disregard for Safety" - With respect to driving violations includes, but is not limited to committing either three or more violations within rapid succession, damaging property, driving on an unpopulated sidewalk, pedestrian passageway, or plaza, meandering between lanes of traffic erratically, demonstrating poor control of the motor vehicle or driving decisions, or driving at excessive speeds while violating other sections of this code.

#### “Weapon” - Any object, tool or item, whether or not regulated or manufactured, that a person utilizes to inflict harm, threaten harm, or utilize in lieu of a regulated or manufactured item that, when used as intended, can inflict harm.

### **(0)04. Classification of Crimes**

#### Infraction - Least serious violation of the penal code. Results in a fine and/or loss of a privilege.

#### Misdemeanor - Minor violation of the penal code. Results in arrest, a fine and/or jail time generally up to 60 seconds.
