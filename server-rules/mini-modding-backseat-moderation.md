# Mini-Modding / Backseat Moderation

"Mini-Modding" or "Backseat Moderation" refers to the behavior of players who take on the role of moderators or administrators in an online community without having the actual authority to do so. It involves individuals attempting to enforce or interpret the rules of a community, often in an unsolicited manner. Here are some examples to illustrate this concept:

<details>

<summary>Enforcing Rules without Authority</summary>

A player warns others about a potential rule violation or reprimands them for breaking a rule, even though they are not a designated moderator or administrator.

<details>

<summary>Giving Unwanted Advice</summary>

Offering unsolicited advice on how others should behave in the community, often in a condescending or authoritative tone.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Assuming Moderator Roles</summary>

Taking on the role of a moderator by telling others what they can or cannot do, issuing warnings, or threatening consequences without the official authority to do so.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Reporting others Publicly</summary>

Publicly calling out other players for rule violations and encouraging others to report them, rather than letting the actual moderation team handle such matters.

</details>

> These behaviors can lead to a negative atmosphere within the community and may cause conflicts. It's generally recommended for players to report rule violations through the appropriate channels, allowing the designated moderators or administrators to address and handle such situations. This ensures a more orderly and fair resolution to any issues within the online community.
