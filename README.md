# Orientation

Welcome to TBLRP. We pride ourselves on realism.

## **Community Rules**

1. Discord is a requirement. If you leave the Discord server, it is considered a resignation.
2. Administrators and Staff will try to keep everyone on topic while in Discord or TeamSpeak, so when asked, move off-topic chats to the appropriate channel.
3. Don’t be an asshole.
4. Political discussion is discouraged as your political leanings don’t matter here. Feel free to post or discuss in the appropriate channel, but understand you might be ignored.
5. Don’t be an asshole. No, really, don’t.
6. You may not give out personal information about other members.
7. For Discord, check the pins in each channel before contributing to the channel.
8. Illegal activity will be dealt with on a case by case basis -- likely immediate removal, permanent ban, and blacklist from our affiliates.
9. Admission to illegal activity in-real-life is grounds for immediate removal, permanent ban, and blacklist from our affiliates -- we don’t want your drama; at all.
10. You are NOT allowed to abuse any privileges that you may have while here. Act appropriately.
11. We do not play politics with other communities. We have our own rules, our own servers, our own Staff and Admins, and a purpose. We as an entity are concerned about ourselves, no one else. We don’t spread rumors about you, so there is no need to spread rumors about us.
12. Furthermore -- we do not tolerate unnecessary drama of any sort. There is no place for it here, as this community is an escape from our normal lives to come and play games, and have fun together.
13. You may not be in TeamSpeak while under the influence of alcohol, with the exception of specific events that would be announced in #announcements.

## FiveM Specific Rules

1. Joining another Emergency Services server on any GTA V platform (FiveM, RageMP, GTA:MP, etc.), FivePD server, or FiveM/RageMP/GTA:MP/etc Community and/or having a role of Member or higher (NOT Fan) in a Discord or TeamSpeak server belonging to one of those servers will be considered a violation of the double clanning policy. In the case of multi-game communities it has to be very clear that the membership is for FiveM/RageMP/GTA:MP/etc specifically and not another game the community offers.
   1. A first offense for double clanning will result in a 7 day temporary ban. You will be temporarily banned from TeamSpeak, muted in Discord, and removed from the whitelist for the duration. You will not lose any tags or tenure. If you continue to double clan during this temporary ban – you will be moved to a community removal with a 30 day ban.
   2. A second offense for double clanning will result in a temporary ban of 90 days – after which you can then re-apply as a brand new member.
   3. A third offense for double clanning will result in a permanent ban, which can be appealed via Discord and a majority vote from the FiveM Staff Team.
2. Returning to the scene after injury, death, being taken to the hospital, or being taken to jail is not permitted.
3. We do not “10-22” or disregard situations. If it is seen, it must be roleplayed.
4. There is to be no out-of-character interactions while in the server. Period.
5. Use of outside communication tools (Discord Calls, other Discord Servers, Snapchat, etc.) are not permitted for patrol. Any kind of coordination for scenes, character development, or discussion related to patrol or Thin Blue Line RP policies and procedures should occur in the Thin Blue Line RP Discord. Third-party communication for these types of things aren't permitted.
6. The age of your character must be at least 18.
7. FRP - Fail RP is not permitted (Repairing vehicle in the middle of a scene, etc)
8. VDM - Vehicle Deathmatching is not permitted (Running over users in retaliation, Demo Derbies, unless approved by staff)

## Avatar & Username Rules

1. No NSFW or semi-NSFW avatars in TS3 or Discord
2. Keep emoticon use in usernames to a minimum. Not a hard rule - just be smart.
3. No provocative, inappropriate, overly sexual, or distracting names/userpics.
4. Photos of community members are not allowed as avatars on discord or TS3 (unless you can prove that the photo is of you)
5. Sound clips of other community members are not allowed unless EXPLICIT permission is given by that person.
6. No political avatars. Politics is an IRL thing - we play video games here. Be smart!

## Inappropriate Behavior towards YouTube / Twitch Streamers

1. Don't @TAG excessively in Discord, or Fan-out over them excessively. That's a pretty quick way to getting kicked from the server or muted in Discord.
2. They are human, treat them as such. Be kind and respectful to them as you would toward other members.

## Connection Points and Additional Related Information

### **TeamSpeak3**

Our Teamspeak 3 server is set up to show all tags and ranks throughout the entire server. There are several patrol rooms for each server, namely the Law Enforcement channel, and the Civilian channel for each server. We also store the required FiveM add-on menu files required on our Teamspeak 3 as well. Teamspeak 3 is the main form of hanging out and communicating with other members, whether playing FiveM or not.

You can join it here: [Teamspeak 3](http://invite.teamspeak.com/198.23.193.242/?addbookmark=TBLRP)

### **Discord Server**

Our Discord server is set up for different roles based on the qualifications you have earned. A lot of useful information is stored on discord, along with the “important-docs” channel which is your one-stop-shop for all relevant guides, policies, and information for FiveM. Discord’s ease of use and great mobile App make Discord a great platform for communication, instead of using a traditional forum system on a website.
